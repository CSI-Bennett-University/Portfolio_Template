## Basics

**HTML** - HTML is used to give structure to your webpage. You add elements such as headings, text, images, etc.

**CSS** - CSS is used to style your website, from colors to animations, transitions, etc.

**GitHub** is a place to host your source code online. It offers a service called **GitHub Pages** that allows you to host your website for free!

Go ahead and edit the `index.html` file to add your relevant details, and if you're feeling adventurous edit the `styles.css` file to play with the styling of your webpage!
